# foo_wpl
WPL playlist plugin for foobar2000 v1.3+

WPL is an XML-based playlist format used by applications like the Windows Media Player.

## Windows 10 Cortana
After an update to Cortana, it no longer uses .wpl playlists, but the MSWINDOWSMUSIC protocol. This means that it is no longer possible to use this plugin to play music from Cortana in foobar2000.
